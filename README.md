# cme-model-vs-in-situ
This is a simulation of a Coronal Mass Ejection (CME or EMC, standing for its initials in spanish). This model uses boundary conditions generated by the CORHEL/MAS software and calculates the plasma properties associated with the CME using the PLUTO code. In addition, some representative physical parameters of the CME (speed, density, temperature and magnetic field) at 1 AU will be estimated. Finally, the simulation results will be compared with in situ measurements obtained from the OMNI database, which is mainly based on observations made by ACE and WIND.


Why?  Well, the Sun has an activity cycle of approximately 11 years, in which there are a variable number of sunspots and active regions in its atmosphere. Active regions are associated in particular with explosive events such as flares and Coronal Mass Ejections (CME). If these events were directed towards the Earth, they could have some serious consequences in technological systems. That's why we do this, because the dynamics of a CME is important to study the interaction between the Sun and the Earth.


This is all about studying the propagation of a particular number of CME events on ambient solar wind conditions in the inner heliosphere by means of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) numerical simulations in three-dimensional spherical coordinates, using the SunRunner3D model.
